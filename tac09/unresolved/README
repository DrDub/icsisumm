Unresolved pronoun classifier (pronouns with an antecedant in a different sentence).

relies on python2.5, icsiboost (http://code.google.com/p/icsiboost), the berkeley parser (http://code.google.com/p/berkeleyparser/).
train it using ontonotes data (LDC2009T24).

fix the path for ontonotes in ./train.sh
put icsiboost in the PATH variable of your shell.
run ./train.sh

a model is provided in icsiboost.{shyp,names} to be used with the threshold in the trace from training (icsiboost.iter).

parse sentences with the berkeley parser (http://code.google.com/p/berkeleyparser/) and put the result in *.sent.tok.parsed. fix the path in decode.sh
run ./decode.sh
