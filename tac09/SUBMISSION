System description:
1) extract concepts
2) find the selection of sentences that maximize weighted concept recall

Concept weighting:
Stem bigrams w/o double stopwords, weighted by document frequency
* specific to set A:
- DF(concept) >= 3
- filter sentences by query
* specific to set B:
- concepts in first sentence count double
- DF(concept) >= 4
- use all sentences

Sentence candidates:
- P(unresolved pronoun) <= 0.4
- length >= 10
- not enclosed in quotes
- overlap with concepts

ILP:
find selection of sentences with length <= 100 words,
that maximize sum_i w_i c_i where w_i is a concept's weight
and c_i denotes it's presence in the summary.
Prefer shorter summaries for same concepts by penalizing
the objective function (- 0.0001 * sum_length)

Ordering:
1) promote first sentence of a document as first of the summary
2) group by document
3) order by date

Sentence segmentation:
use the Splitta system
reglue sentences in quotes

Preprocessing:
clean up first sentence in article (remove datelines, titles, authorship)
remove some say-clauses at the end of sentences
remove some adverbs at the begining of sentences

Compression:
Semantic Role Labeling (B. Bohnet's CoNLL'09 System)
- allow removal of AM-TMP and AM-MNR (temporal and manner), if score > 0.6
- allow removal of said-clauses (say, tell, write, report)
- allow removal of TMP arcs from dependency parse tree if contains day-of-week and len < 4
- keep 10-longest compressions, drop if length < orig_len / 2
- remove parentheses
- detokenize

Unresolved pronoun detection:
Training on OntoNotes 2.9 (WSJ) Coref data.
Features extracted from parse tree (berkeley parser).
Icsiboost (adaboost) classifier.
F-score ~ 90 at the pronoun level
